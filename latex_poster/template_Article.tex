\section{What is a Neural Network?}

A Neural Network is a machine learning model roughly based on the makeup of the brain. A NN is comprised of a series of \textbf{layers}. Each of these layers is comprised of \textbf{neurons}. Each neuron has an output, known as an \textbf{activation}, which is simply a linear combination of the outputs (activations) of the previous layers.

The connections between the neurons are often called \textbf{synapses}. Each synapse has an associated value which is the coefficient in the linear combination that produces the neurons in the next layer. The associated values of all the synapses between two layers comprise a \textbf{weight matrix}.
